This tool converts sql to elasticsearch dsl

Currently support:

- [x] sql and expression
- [x] sql or expression
- [x] equal(=) support
- [x] not equal(!=) support
- [x] gt(>) support
- [x] gte(>=) support
- [x] lt(<) support
- [x] lte(<=) support
- [x] sql in (eg. id in (1,2,3) ) expression
- [x] sql not in (eg. id not in (1,2,3) ) expression
- [x] paren bool support (eg. where (a=1 or b=1) and (c=1 or d=1))
- [x] sql like expression (currently use match phrase, perhaps will change to wildcard in the future)
- [x] sql order by support
- [x] sql limit support
- [x] sql not like expression
- [x] field missing check
- [x] support aggregation like count(\*), count(field), min(field), max(field), avg(field)
- [x] support aggregation like stats(field), extended_stats(field), percentiles(field) which are not standard sql function
- [ ] null check expression(is null/is not null)
- [ ] join expression
- [ ] having support

Usage
-------------

> go get -u github.com/cch123/elasticsql

Demo :
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/cch123/elasticsql"
)

var sql = `
select * from aaa
where a=1 and x = '三个男人'
and create_time between '2015-01-01T00:00:00+0800' and '2016-01-01T00:00:00+0800'
and process_id > 1 order by id desc limit 100,10
`

func main() {
    dsl, esType, _ := elasticsql.Convert(sql)
    fmt.Println(dsl)
    fmt.Println(esType)
}

```
will produce :
```json
{
    "query": {
        "bool": {
            "must": [
                {
                    "match": {
                        "a": {
                            "query": "1",
                            "type": "phrase"
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    "match": {
                        "x": {
                            "query": "三个男人",
                            "type": "phrase"
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    "range": {
                        "create_time": {
                            "from": "2015-01-01T00:00:00+0800",
                            "to": "2016-01-01T00:00:00+0800"
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    "range": {
                        "process_id": {
                            "gt": "1"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "from": 100,
    "size": 10,
    "sort": [
        {
            "id": "desc"
        }
    ]
}


```

If your sql contains some keywords, eg. order, timestamp, don't forget to escape these fields as follows:

```
select * from `order` where `timestamp` = 1 and `desc`.id > 0
```

Warning
------------
To use this tool, you need to understand the term query and match phrase query of elasticsearch.

Setting a field to analyzed or not analyzed will get different results.

Details
------------
For more details of convertion, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/cch123/elasticsql/wiki)

Other info
------------
When writing this tool, I tried to avoid the deprecated dsl filters and aggregations, so it is compatible with most versions of the elasticsearch
